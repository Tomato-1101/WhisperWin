# SuperWhisper-like App Settings

# Hotkey to trigger recording (e.g., '<f2>', '<ctrl>+<space>')
# See pynput documentation for key names
hotkey: '<ctrl>+<space>'

# Hotkey mode: 'toggle' (press to start, press again to stop) or 'hold' (hold to record)
hotkey_mode: 'hold'

# Whisper model size: tiny, base, small, medium, large, large-v2, large-v3
# You can specify any model supported by faster-whisper (e.g., 'large-v3', 'distil-large-v3')
model_size: 'large-v3'

# Device: 'cuda' (GPU) or 'cpu'
# If 'cuda' is not available, it will fall back to 'cpu' automatically
device: 'cuda'

# Compute type: 'float16', 'int8_float16', 'int8', 'float32'
# 'float16' is recommended for GPU, 'int8' for CPU or older GPUs
compute_type: 'float16'

# CPU threads to use for inference (only used when device is 'cpu')
cpu_threads: 4

# Language: 'ja' (Japanese), 'en' (English), etc.
# Leave empty for auto-detection (slower)
language: 'ja'

# Memory Management
# Time in seconds to wait before releasing VRAM after the last transcription
# Set to 0 to never release (keep loaded), or a positive integer (e.g., 300 for 5 mins)
release_memory_delay: 100

# Advanced Transcription Settings
# VAD (Voice Activity Detection) settings
vad_filter: true
vad_min_silence_duration_ms: 500

# Hallucination prevention settings
condition_on_previous_text: false  # Set to false to prevent repetition loops
no_speech_threshold: 0.6           # Threshold for silence probability (0.0 - 1.0)
log_prob_threshold: -1.0           # Threshold for average log probability (negative value)
no_speech_prob_cutoff: 0.7         # Cutoff threshold for segment no_speech_prob (0.0 - 1.0)
beam_size: 5                       # Beam size for decoding
